A website template for running hackathons, started by me during my time as head webmaster at [IEEE University of Toronto](https://ieee.utoronto.ca/). Includes user enrollment and applications, an application review portal, RSVP system, batch mailer, and an e-commerce esque platform for signing out hardware during events. Built with Django, React, Postgres, Redis, and more.

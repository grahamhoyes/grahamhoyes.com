A guide on deploying an app with Django, Redis, and Postgres on Docker Swarm. Includes a basic demo application, cluster setup, and a zero-downtime CD pipeline with GitHub Actions. A great option for deploying small apps where you want a load balancer and zero-downtime deployments, without the complexity of Kubernetes.

My custom Programmer Dvorak-based layout for split keyboards. Originally designed for the [Ergodox EZ](https://configure.zsa.io/ergodox-ez/layouts/nlErD/latest/0), and now adapted to my daily driver the [Zodiark](https://www.splitlogic.xyz/) in QMK. Features home-row layer toggles for switching to numbers, symbols, and function keys without moving your hands.

My common configuration files, with an emphasis on KDE but somewhat relevant for Mac as well. Includes a script for setting up a Kubuntu install to my liking from scratch (run at your own risk). My preferred terminal is Zsh, with a custom Powerlevel10k theme. [DejaVu Sans Mono Nerd Font](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/tree/master/patched-fonts/DejaVuSansMono) is my typical monospace font for terminal and IDEs.

<Ingredients>
    - 500g flour (ideally bread flour)
    - 8g kosher salt
    - 370g lukewarm water
    - Active dry yeast
        - For same-day: 5g
        - For overnight no-knead or cold ferment: 2g
</Ingredients>

<Steps>
    1. Add the yeast to the water and let sit for a few minutes until it starts to foam.
        - If it doesn't foam, your yeast is dead.
    2. Add the flour and salt to a large bowl and mix.
    3. Add the water and yeast mixture to the flour and mix with a wooden spoon until roughly combined.

    How to proceed depends on whether you want to make the dough same-day, or if you want to do a no-knead or cold ferment.

    ## Same-day

    4. Knead the dough until it is smooth and elastic, about 10 minutes.
    5. Cover the bowl with an airtight lid and let rise for 2 hours.
    6. Divide the dough into 4 equal pieces and shape into balls.
        - Freeze any unused dough balls in an airtight vessel, or optionally switch to cold fermenting them.
    7. Let the dough balls rise for another 2 hours.

    ## Overnight No-Knead

    This is what I normally do. Do steps 1-3 about 24 hours before you want to make pizza.

    4. Cover the bowl with an airtight lid and let rise for 4 hours.
    5. Gently fold the dough over itself a few times to deflate it. Let sit covered overnight.
    6. Repeat the folding process a few times the next day, once the dough doubles in size.
    7. Two hours before pizza time, divide the dough into 4 equal pieces and shape into balls.
        - Freeze any unused dough balls in an airtight vessel, or optionally switch to cold fermenting them.
    8. Let the dough balls rise for another hour.

    ## Cold Ferment

    This is the most time-consuming method, but it produces the best results.

    4. Follow steps 4-6 of the overnight no-knead method. Proceed to step 5 as soon as the dough is homogenous, you don't need to wait the full 24 hours (12 should be fine).
    5. Divide the dough into 4 equal pieces and shape into balls.
    6. Place the balls into individual well-oiled containers and cover with an airtight lid.
    7. Place in the fridge for 4-7 days, without disturbing the dough.
    8. After 4-7 days, remove the dough from the fridge and let sit at room temperature for 2 hours.
        - If you have more dough than you need, freeze in the current containers.
    9. Do not re-ball the dough.

    ## Defrosting Frozen Dough

    Frozen dough from any of the above methods can be defrosted in the fridge overnight, then letting sit at room temperature for 2 hours. Or go right to room temperature for 6 hours.

    ## Making Pizza

    1. Preheat your oven as hot as it will go (500 Â°F or higher) for at least an hour, with a pizza stone or steel inside.<br />\
       If you have a "roast" setting that enables the top and bottom elements, use it. Enable convection as well, if available.
    2. Using your hands, stretch the dough into a roughly 11-inch pizza shape.
    3. Add toppings (left as an exercise to the reader).
    4. Transfer the pizza to the oven and bake for 5-7 minutes, until desired done-ness is achieved.

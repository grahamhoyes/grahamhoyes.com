<Ingredients>
    Makes: 4 pizzas

    - 640 g bread flour
        - At least 12% protein
    - 18 g kosher salt
    - 450 g lukewarm water
    - 8 g yeast
</Ingredients>

<Steps>
    1. Add the yeast to the water, stir, and let sit for a few minutes until it starts to foam.
        - If it doesn't foam, your yeast is dead.
    2. Add the flour and salt to a large bowl and mix.
    3. Add the water and yeast mixture to the flour and mix with a wooden spoon until roughly combined.
    4. Cover the bowl with an airtight lid and let rest for 30 minutes.
    5. With a soaking wet hand, perform a stretch-and-fold by grabbing one edge of the dough and pulling
       up until just before it tears, then laying it back down over the rest. Rotate 90°, then repeat 3 more times.
    6. Wait another 30 minutes, then perform another stretch and fold. Repeat once more, for a total of 3 stretches and
       about an hour and a half of resting.
    7. Divide the dough into 4 equal pieces, about 280 g each. Roll each into a tight ball by tucking the dough under
       itself and pulling the outer side underneath and towards you on your work surface.
    8. Place the balls into individual well-oiled containers and cover with an airtight lid.
    9. Place in the fridge for 4-7 days (ideally 7), without disturbing the dough.
    10. Prior to making pizza, remove the dough from the fridge at let sit at room temperature for 1 hour. Do not
        re-ball the dough prior to pressing out and making a pizza.

    ### Freezing

    This dough freezes well. Move any extra dough from the fridge to the freezer in the same containers after
    cold fermenting has finished, without disturbing them.

    To thaw, leave at room temperature in the same containers for 4 hours prior to baking.

    How to proceed depends on whether you want to make the dough same-day, or if you want to do a no-knead or cold ferment.

    ### Making Pizza

    1. Preheat your oven as hot as it will go (500 °F or higher) for at least an hour, with a pizza stone or steel
       inside on the center rack.<br />\
       If you have a "roast" setting that enables the top and bottom elements, use it. Enable convection as well, if available.
    2. Using your hands, stretch the dough into a roughly 11-inch pizza shape.
    3. Before you add your toppings, put the oven on broil to extra-heat the pizza stone or steal.
    3. Add toppings to your pizza (left as an exercise to the reader).
    4. Transfer the pizza to the oven, turn oven back to convect roast or bake mode, and bake for 5-7 minutes
       until desired done-ness is achieved.

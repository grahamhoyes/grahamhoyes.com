<Ingredients>
    - 1 butternut squash
    - 1 medium carrot, diced
    - 1 medium onion, diced
    - 1 granny smith apple, cored, peeled, and diced
    - 1.5 L chicken or vegetable broth
    - 120 mL cream
    - 2 bay leaves
    - 60g (4 Tbsp) butter
    - Sprinkle of dried thyme
    - Olive oil
    - Salt and pepper
</Ingredients>

<Steps>
    1. Preheat oven to 425 F. Prepare a parchment-lined baking tray.
    2. Halve the squash, remove the seeds and pulp. Rub the flesh lightly with olive oil, then bake flesh side down until easily poked with a fork, about 40 minutes.
        - Alternatively, peel the squash and dice into 2 cm cubes while raw, toss in olive oil, and roast for about 30 minutes.
    3. Let the squash cool until handleable, then peel off the skin. Roughly cut the squash into 2 cm cubes.
    4. Add butter to a pot on medium. Optionally, stir for a few minutes until the milk solids begin to brown.
    5. Add diced carrot and onion to the pot. Saute until the onions are soft but not browned, about 10 minutes.
    6. Add the diced apple, squash, broth, bay leaf, and thyme to the pot. Simmer for about 15 minutes.
    7. Remove the pot from the heat. Discard the bay leaf.
    8. Using an immersion blender, blend the soup until desired level of smoothness.
    9. Add the cream, stirring to incorporate.
    10. Season with salt and pepper to taste.

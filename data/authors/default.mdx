I'm a Senior Software Engineer based in Toronto, Canada. I obtained my BASc in Engineering Science from the University of Toronto with a major in Machine Intelligence. I regularly work with Python, TypeScript, Rust, Postgres, Kubernetes, and various big-scale databases in distributed environments.

Professionally, I build distributed systems and backend infrastructure for internet telephony, focusing on integrating AI capabilities into real-time media processing at scale. Most of my work involves designing systems that handle millions of real-time interactions and solving problems around database architecture, fault tolerance, and scalability. I'm particularly interested in distributed systems, site reliability engineering, and developer tooling.

In my free time, I enjoy starting web development projects (and sometimes even finishing them), playing the saxophone and [EWI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYie77YHkns), tweaking my [Dvorak-based keyboard layout](https://github.com/grahamhoyes/qmk_firmware/blob/grahamhoyes/zodiark/keyboards/aleblazer/zodiark/keymaps/grahamhoyes/keymap.c), [homelabbing](https://github.com/grahamhoyes/homelab), and CAD / 3D printing.

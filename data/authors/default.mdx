I am a Software Engineer based in Toronto, Canada. I obtained my BASc in Engineering Science from the University of Toronto, with a major in Machine Intelligence. My areas of professional interest are AI, scalable systems, and improving developer efficiency.

In my free time, I enjoy starting web development projects (and sometimes even finishing them), playing the saxophone and [EWI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYie77YHkns), tweaking my [Dvorak-based keyboard layout](https://github.com/grahamhoyes/qmk_firmware/blob/grahamhoyes/zodiark/keyboards/aleblazer/zodiark/keymaps/grahamhoyes/keymap.c), and CAD / 3D printing. I also enjoy cooking and fermenting things - recipes section coming soon (once I code that, see above).

```rust showLineNumbers
pub fn main() {
    let foo = "hello";
}
```
